Please add the following icon files to make the PWA work properly:

## Required Icon Files:

- `app-icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels) - Android Icon  
- `app-icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels) - Large Icon
- `favicon.ico` - Website favicon

## Icon Design Tips:
- Use bright, child-friendly colors
- Include the WordBuddy logo or a speech bubble
- Make it recognizable at small sizes
- Consider using emojis like üéØ or üó£Ô∏è or üë∂
